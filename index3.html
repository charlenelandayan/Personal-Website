                    <h1>WHAT IS UX?</h1>
                    <p>

                    UX DESIGN IS A STILL A RELATIVELY NEW FIELD, WITH MANY COMPANIES ONLY JUST WAKING UP TO THE FACT THAT THEY NEED YOU ON THE PAYROLL IF THEY WANT TO SUCCEED IN ATTRACTING AND RETAINING CUSTOMERS.
                    PART OF THE CONFUSION COULD LIE IN THE NAME: UX DESIGN. FOR MANY PEOPLE, THE WORD “DESIGN” IS ASSOCIATED WITH CREATIVITY, COLORS AND GRAPHICS, WHEN REALLY ITS TRUE DEFINITION LIES IN FUNCTIONALITY, AS WELL AS THE PROCESS BEHIND MAKING PRODUCTS THAT WORK WELL FOR THE PEOPLE WHO USE THEM.
                    KNOWING WHO THE TARGET CUSTOMERS ARE, AND HOW TO MAKE THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH YOUR PRODUCT THE MOST REWARDING OR “DELIGHTFUL” IT CAN BE, IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE UX DESIGN TEAM. AS SUCH, FUNCTIONALITY AND “USABILITY” SHOULD RANK HIGH IN YOUR LIST OF PRIORITIES FOR YOUR PRODUCT.

                IF THERE’S AN OCCUPATION THAT IS 100% LINKED WITH THE PUBLIC’S IDEA OF WHAT DESIGN IS ALL ABOUT, IT’S GRAPHIC DESIGN. FROM THE FAMILIAR GOLDEN ARCHES OF THE MCDONALD’S BRAND TO THE TYPOGRAPHY AND COLORS OF MOVIE POSTERS, GRAPHIC DESIGNERS CREATE SOME OF THE MOST ICONIC AND UBIQUITOUS DESIGNS AROUND US. SO WHY WOULD A GRAPHIC DESIGNER LIKE YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR CAREER TO UX DESIGN? WELL, FOR ONE, MUCH CAN BE SAID ABOUT THE SENSE OF SATISFACTION AND FULFILLMENT DERIVED FROM GETTING “UNDER THE HOOD” OF THE PRODUCTS YOU WORK ON RATHER THAN WORKING ON THE EXTERIOR. FURTHERMORE, ACCORDING TO PAYSCALE, THE AVERAGE SALARY FOR A GRAPHIC DESIGNER IN THE UNITED STATES IS $41,000(1), BUT THE SAME FOR A UX DESIGNER IS A WHOPPING $74,000(2).
